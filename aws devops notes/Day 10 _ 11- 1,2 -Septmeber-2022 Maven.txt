MAVEN TOOL :

Maven is a java based build tool.
vendor is apache

build tools:

maven ----building java source code
msbuild --building dotnet source code
pybuild --python source code


sourcecode of java -------> Maven -------> package


3 types of packages we can create:

Jar
War
ear

Jar-java archived -- standalone application --caluclator
war-web archived  -- web application---gmail, facebook,any website
ear-enterprise archived--multi module application 

since maven is a java based tool--prerequisite is java

once linux machine is created and connected 
go to root user
sudo su - (command to move to root user)

go to the opt folder to install any third-party softwares
cd /opt

if wget command is not founnd, first install wget by using below command
yum install wget -y

To Install java in linux system,use wget command and download link of java
wget https://download.oracle.com/java/18/latest/jdk-18_linux-x64_bin.rpm

once rpm package is downloaded,use the following command to install 
yum install jdk-18_linux-x64_bin.rpm -y

once java is installed,check java version by using the below command
java -version

then download and install maven with the below command
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.zip

to extract the zip package,need to install unzip package
yum install unzip -y

then unzip the maven package by using the following command
unzip apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.zip

after installing java & maven
to set path, use the following commands
echo "export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$M2_HOME/bin' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

Now dowmload the java source code from github ,the command is
git clone https://github.com/shashirajraja/onlinebookstore.git

If git command is not found, then
yum install git -y

once source code is downloaded, then go to the folder where pom.xml is available
cd onlinebookstore

then execute the maven commands to compile the source code and to create the package
mvn validate
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package
mvn install
mvn deploy


maven life cycles     ---------   goals
