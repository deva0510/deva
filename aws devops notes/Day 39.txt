Host scope variables
--------------------
These variables are classified into 2 types
1) Variables to work on group of hosts
2) Variables to work on single hosts

 Variables to work on group of hosts
---------------------------------------
These variables are designed to work on group of hosts.
They are definined in a folder called  group_vars
This group_vars folder should be presnent in the same folder
where all the playbooks are present.
In this group_vars folder, we should create a file who's name is 
same as group_name in Inventory file.
In this file we create variables.


Varible which works on group of hosts

$ cd  ( enter)
$ cd playbooks
$ ls
	
Varibles which work in group of hosts are divided into two types
1) Variables which work in group of machines
2) Variables which work on one machine

 Variables which work in group of machines
------------------------------------------------
playbooks$ mkdir group_vars

Note:  group_vars  folder should be present in the same location of
 playbook files.

$ cd group_vars
$  vim webserver


a: Prakash
b: logiclabs
c: /home/Prakash
d: 67809
e: /bin/bash

Save and Quit

$ cd ..
playbooks$ vim playbook8.yml

Variables to work on single hosts
These variables  are designed on single machine.
Thet are created in folder called host_wars

$ cd host_vars
$ vim 172.31.39.81        ( 172.31.39.81  private Ip of server4 )
