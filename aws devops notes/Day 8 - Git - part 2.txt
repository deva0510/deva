Branching
--------------
This feature is provided in git, so that developers can create code related
to different functionalities  on seprate branches.
This helps the development team in creating the code in an uncluttered way.
Later this code can be merged with master branch.
Default branch of git is "Master"

ex:git branch development
   git branch testing
   git branch production

git checkout â€“b branchname (Creating a branch and check out to the branch at a time)
                 
git push --all -u  (How to all push local branches to remote repository)
