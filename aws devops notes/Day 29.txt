Kubernetes
------------------------
Google created this kubernetes.
It is a opensource tool.
Pre-requisite is docker.

k8s  -- 8 letters between  k  and  s

It is a container orchestration tool.
 
Kubernetes creates cluster, deploy and manage clusters.

By using kubernetes we form a cluster
K8S schedules, runs and managers isolated containers.

Convert isolated containers running on different hardwares into a cluster.

In AWS we have a service EKS  ( Elastic kuberneters service )

Features of kubernetes
---------------------------------
1) Orchestration (  clustering any no of containers on different hardwares)
2) Auto scaling
3) Auto healing ( new containers in place of crashed containers 
                              similar to handling failover scenarios in docker swarm )
4) load balancing
5) rollback  ( going to previous versions )


Kubernetes Architecture
-------------------------------

Cluster is combination of 1 master and multiple nodes.

Pod is atomic unit of deployment in kubernetes.

Pod consists of one or more docker containers.
Pod runs on node.
Node is controlled by Kubernetes master


Kubernetes does not understand containers.


Kubernetes can understand only pods.


In this diagram , we have one master and one node.
node is also called minion.
Kubernetes master is also called as control plane.
